[_"It is totally without logic to propose that after millions of years of evolution during which mankind have become the dominant species on this planet that somehow our bodies have become structurally incompetent or that we have become so fragile that we must be careful of how we move how we use our bodies or engage in repetitive activities this is unadulterated nonsense we are not made of paper masche we are tough and resilient adaptable and quick to heal"_]- _Dr. John Sarno_

#### _What is chronic pain?_
![](/images/07a8c7b578fd43a76a53709fa4ade051--pain-management-arthritis.jpg)

It can be mild or excruciatingly episodic or continuous merely inconvenient or totally incapacitating and has been going on for months or longer.

Anyone who has had long-term or even chronic pain knows very well that it's one of the most detrimental things to our quality of life. The pain can be caused by a variety of issues with the bones, joints, nerves, or muscles. Depending on the source of the pain treatment can involve the use of painkillers or physical therapy. Surgery is also an option but if the pain is coming from other issues (discs, ligaments, joint arthritis, myofascial pains, nerve injury) -- then surgery may not do anything for the pain. This is because like most chronic pain back pain is very difficult to treat because it is difficult to find out where the pain is coming from.

Back pain is one of the most common cause of job-related disability and a leading contributor to missed work days. Perhaps you yourself are suffering from chronic lower back pain or perhaps even experiencing chronic pain elsewhere such as your joints, nerves, or muscles. If so then you've probably been bounced from pillar to post starting with your local doctor who eventually took you seriously enough to and refer you to a medical specialist They may have ordered X-rays or EMG tests to find the issue. They advise rest but that didn't help you were prescribed physical therapy. That didn't work either so you were you then referred to a rheumatologist or neurologist or perhaps both. So you decide to try alternative medicine; you know chiropractors, osteopaths, acupuncturists, massage therapists, nutritionists but still the pain remains.

#### _So Many Specialist, So Many Test, So Many Different Answers_
Seems like there's always something a doctor or specialist can point to as the cause of you pain. Perhaps you've noticed some of your symptoms don't really makes sense. One day it's neck and shoulder pain the other day it's lower back pain, or even leg pain. In my opinion I believe Dr. Sarno has come further towards solving these kinds of problems than anyone in the western medical field has ever come close to. Working out of the Rusk Institute of Rehabilitation Medicine in New York. Dr. Sarno worked for decades with patients who ha chronic pain disorders of different kinds he is primarily a back doctor and so he has dealt mostly with back problems. He saw many cases where his patients didn’t respond as he expected to the conventional treatments of the day, considering the physical symptoms with which they presented. In addition to complaints about neck, back, and shoulder pain he noticed a connection that his patients often shared a common pattern of underlying tension. His approach is simple. Chronic pain is caused by repressed emotions in the unconscious mind.

#### _We Repress Out of Necessity_
![](/images\spine-anatomy-gray-orange.jpg)

Dr. Sarno tends to see the most persistent cases of chronic pain. Those people who have had problems for many years. What he tells them is this your problems are not physical you are not injured in any way. The pain however is real it's not just in your head it's real physical pain but the cause is emotional the cause is repressed rage in the unconscious mind. Not only are repressed emotions such as the source chronic pain but also claims it's the source of headaches, migraines, pelvic pain, irritable bowel and other gastrointestinal complaints, chronic fatigue, fibromyalgia, carpal tunnel and repetitive strain syndromes, vertigo, dizziness, insomnia and even psychological equivalents such as anxiety, panic attacks, depression, phobias and many other similar conditions where you have pain but don't really know why sometimes manifests with weaknesses in the muscles sometimes with tingling sensations but we often doctors have no idea how to actually cure them so they give drugs to help reduce the pain temporarily but does nothing for it in the long term. He termed this phenomenon Tension myositis syndrome or TMS for short. His treatment for TMS involves no medication no physical therapy none of that it is purely an educational therapy.

#### _Chronic Pain: An Epidemic of Fear?_
The purpose of the pain is to divert your attention from an internalised rage to keep it well hidden in the unconscious mind because to see it would be worse than the pain or so the unconscious mind thinks. The unconscious mind works very differently to the conscious mind and as a result of this different both respond to and process emotionally charged events and traumas very differently...

In reality we have three minds we have the conscious, the unconscious and the subconscious and as Dr. Sarno explains:

_"It is an interesting fact that the overwhelming majority of emotional and mental activity occurs below the level of consciousness. The human mind is something like an iceberg. The part that we are aware of, the conscious mind, represents a very small part of the total. It is in the subconscious mind that all of the complicated processing goes on…this condition begins and ends in the unconscious."_

The unconscious is the ocean from which all ice is made.

Dr. Sarno's work is primarily concerned with the conscious and the unconscious aspects of the mind. The subconscious is a fascinating area but it's only relevant to the extent that this is where learning takes place.

In his books he describes the different personality traits that are common among TMS patients.

* Perfectionists
* People pleasers
* Highly anxious people
* Stoic individuals
* Low self-esteem

He brings up some examples of things that might make your unconscious mind angry to the point of rage. For instance it can be the man who felt compelled to participate in an activity he dislikes to please his wife or the adult taking care of his or her elderly parents not objecting consciously but seething inwardly. It can be the young man and woman who was sexually abused as child or the woman with six children who loves being a mother but is unaware of her inner rage at all that motherhood entails or it can be the 55 year old has been angry at their mother or father since childhood.

#### _Show me the evidence_
So is there any evidence for such a claim? Well neuroscientists have shown how your occupation can alter the very structure of your brain. For instance scientists have shown that [black-cab taxi drivers have a larger (hence more developed) area of the brain responsible for storing memory called the hippocampus compared to non-taxi drivers](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC18253/) and that [gymnasts have a larger area of the brain responsible for complex movement called the cerebellum](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC18253/).Then there's the stuff of everyday life. For example when your mouth becomes dry just as you're about to address an audience; the feeling of butterflies in your stomach, the movie that makes your heart skip a beat, or those worries running around in your head that stop you from getting a wink of sleep. It's no secret that our bodies are intimately connected to our minds more so our emotions, how could it be otherwise..?

Okay, so you might be thinking "well I have an x-ray showing a herniated disk or a scan showing some from of abnormality or something similar that points to the cause of your pain however for example a study [published in the New England Journal of Medicine by Maureen Jensen her group studied](https://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJM199407143310201) MRI scans on people who had no symptoms of back pain. 52% of these randomly selected subjects had bulges and protrusions but no symptoms of pain. Given the high prevalence of their findings they came to the conclusion that the discovery of bulges, protrusions by MRI in patients with back pain may be nothing more than coincidental; and that what MRI scans are picking up are normal changes associated with activity and ageing but not pain.

Alright, so you might understand all of this intellectually, but what's actually happening? Well the truth is no one really understands what the brain actually doing on a normal day --how we think or even comprehend language. This lack of understanding also extends to the brains ability to can cause physical symptoms. However clinical evidence suggests TMS is brought about by the brain through the autonomic nervous system. The autonomic nervous system is a subsection of the central nervous system that controls the body's involuntary functions which include the activates our fight, freeze or flight response and the circulation of blood. It's suggest that the prolonged activation of the fight or flight response during stressful situations with no ability to escape the situation leads to the restriction of flow blood to the target tissues. As a result the level of available oxygen is decreased and the effect is pain if a muscle or tendon is targeted or numbness, tingling and weakness if a nerve is involved. This mild oxygen deprivation is thought to be the basis for symptoms of tension, dysfunction and physical pain in TMS. It also explains why massages and exercise can cause temporary pain relief in the affected areas as it simply increases blood flow which temporarily increases oxygen levels.

The medical community has adopted mechanical approach to treating health. That is to say that medical professionals treat the body a well oiled machine; with poor health being and or chronic pain being the malfunctioning or the breakdown of some mechanical process of the body. While this is mostly a useful analogy it completely disregards the role of the mind and emotions plays in health. This is Where a mechanical approach to medicine fall shot. The need for doctors to point to some sort of structural defect as the underlining cause of chronic pain as led to many medical specialists playing medical whack-a-mole with patients medical health. Treating symptoms and hoping the problem goes away is not a very effective strategy.

Our mental health is often a neglected both at social and personal level. This neglect is in part due to a lack of social resources, a lack of trained health-care providers as well as the social stigma associated with talking about ones mental health. Mental health has become a major public health issue that needs to be taken seriously.

If you've been though the medical mill with chronic pain and left feeling lost as to what to do about your pain; or you know someone close to you who maybe dealing with chronic pain then I implore you to take back control of your health and quality of life by reading one of Dr. Sarno's books and change your Perception of pain today.

_Hope this helps..._
