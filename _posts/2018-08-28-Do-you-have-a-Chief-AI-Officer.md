<span style="font-weight:400;">Society is now at an inflection point; and as such organizations really need to be thinking about executive level responsibility for AI in and machine learning a collective and responsive way. </span>

<span style="font-weight:400;">That doesn't mean that every organization needs to get out and name a new chief AI officer, it does mean that your company should have some metric for measuring accountability at a the senior management level of your business.</span>
&nbsp;
<h2><strong>Talent</strong></h2>
<span style="font-weight:400;">Now this is just machine learning and technical talent AI. this will only get your company so far. Instead you must expand our definition of AI talent to include to thinking about the how AI can be used by your workforce as well as the impact of AI technologies more broadly.</span>
<h2><strong>Data </strong></h2>
<span style="font-weight:400;">A lot of data in most organization is siloed. If you want AI run across your entire business as smoothly as possible one unifying view of data governance across the organization is necessary. To accomplish this your CAO needs to pull these data sources together and govern them accordingly. </span>
<h2><strong>Responsibility</strong></h2>
<span style="font-weight:400;">Responsible AI is the third broad category your organization needs to make sure they're ready for. </span><span style="font-weight:400;">One only needs to read the news around some of the  big tech companies to understand where they go wrong. As such it's paramount that companies needing to start thinking more about </span><span style="font-weight:400;">issues surrounding AI and Big data.</span>

Here are some values to help shape your ethics and principles in AI governance
<ul>
	<li><span style="font-weight:400;"> <b>Accountability</b></span>
<ol>
	<li><span style="font-weight:400;">your business need to think about where it's going to be comfortable drawing the line between machines being accountable for things (expert systems)</span></li>
	<li><span style="font-weight:400;">where humans need to be in the loop. There are very few things you want to trust to machines, so you really need to think about the human level accountability.</span></li>
</ol>
</li>
</ul>
<ul>
	<li><span style="font-weight:400;"> <b>Transparency</b> </span>
<ol>
	<li><span style="font-weight:400;">which gets into explainable as well. Where is it okay for a machine to decide something and you have not to know why? </span></li>
	<li><span style="font-weight:400;">where does it come from, who is it collected, governance , storage </span><span style="font-weight:400;">algorithms - they are black boxes &gt; governance, Regulation and codes of conduct </span></li>
</ol>
</li>
</ul>
<ul>
	<li><span style="font-weight:400;"> <b>Fairness</b></span>
<ul>
	<li><span style="font-weight:400;">There's a big issue with data being biased. Failure to screen your data for bias only increases the odds that your data contains unwanted biases. In today's society biased data will put a companies reputation at as well as its consumers at risk. That's unacceptable. We need to make sure that fairness is enforced. </span></li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<ul>
	<li><span style="font-weight:400;"><b>Honesty</b></span>
<ul>
	<li><span style="font-weight:400;"> It wouldn't too difficult to build AI systems that can take advantage of grey areas and loopholes in law and legislation. Instead we should be designing our AI systems to be honest and follow the rules that we've set for society instead of gaming the system. Let's say example  your company is building self-driving car or perhaps a car with AI sensing technology embedded inside. Such as car should follow the speed limit. However this can probably, very easily sense where the traffic zones are, where the speed cameras are, as well as the police and from that data  and game the system, but it shouldn't. </span></li>
</ul>
