## Can AI really fix a broken process?

### _The Scenario_

Mark has toothache for the three days, he can’t ignore as it’s affecting his performance at work. He realizes that he needs to see a dentist but he hasn’t been for a dental appointment in a few good years and so he will need to register with a clinic. He calls one up clinic for their next available appointment or an emergency appointment if available. He told that due dental policies all patients must be registered with the clinic before being seen for a standard or emergency appointment. So Mark is emailed a set of forms to fill in. He can either post these forms or hand them in to the reception on the day of his appointment.

Mark decides to take the documents with him to his dentist appointment were he hand these forms to the  admin staff who then spends a few minutes entering the information. After which Mark attends and completes his dental appointment. A few months later Mark gets a new job on the outskirts of town and so decides to move closer to his new place of work. He calls to let his dentist know that he has changed address and so they send him a copy of his old information to which he must update and then mail it back for the admin team to read and update their medical system.

### _The Problem_
While Mark is unlikely to be changing place of residence very often he is only one of thousands patients who visit the dental clinic; need to update some detail on the dental system. The system is setup in such a way that entering of patient information is a time consuming and laborious job. It's so time consuming that there is a backlog data to enter onto the system and the manager of the dental clinic has to pay clerks weekend and overtime in order to keep up-to-date with all patients details across the network of dental clinics which is expensive.

### _The Solution_

The CEO and manager of the dental clinic put their heads together and decide that they want to utilize the power of AI in their organisation. In particular they want to use a computer vision system to recognise handwritten text so they can automatically scan the text to the clinics database. In this wise patients can hand in their updated details and all the clerks have to do is scan the documents through the computer. The dental company is willing to spend pretty penny in order to purchase, configure and integrate  such an AI system with their existing computers as they have calculated that it will save them money in the long term.

### _The Result_
After the upgrade the patient process still remains the same but now instead of a person entering the data; the system automatically scans and recognises that text and puts it in the computer. The managers celebrate the success of the work.

### _A Second Look_
If we step back and think about the process more holistically you should realise that the process should have been fixed in the first place before considering an AI solution. Essentially nothing really changed except for one step which is now AI enabled. Instead of employing an AI system to solve their problem the dental company could have given patients a unique patient URL that would enable each patient to update their own personal information. If done correctly this would not only save the company money, time and resources but it could also be used to strengthening existing data protection policies which AI alone would not.

### _The Moral of this Story_
As seen from the example given their  problem could have been sold without the complexity of AI or in this case computer vision. The moral of the story here is no to blindly follow the current trends in technology without thinking about what problem your trying to solve. Your company's digital journey is important. And as such all process should be digitally optimised before reaching for AI technologies. Instead we have many companies jumping on the machine learning bandwagon if only to seem hip and trendy when in reality they really don't need to.

_Hope this helps_
