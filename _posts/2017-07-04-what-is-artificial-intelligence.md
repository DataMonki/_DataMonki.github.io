 # __Demystified: What is Artificial Intelligence?__

 ![](https://apragmatic.files.wordpress.com/2018/08/null1.png) 

The easiest way to think about artificial intelligence (AI) is in the context of a human cognition, after all humans are arguably the most intelligent creatures that we know of.

AI is a broad branch of computer science. The goal of AI is to create systems that can function intelligently and independently.
<ul>
	<li>Humans can speak and listen to communicate through language. In AI development this is the field of <b>speech recognition.</b> Much of speech recognition is statistically based hence it's called statistical learning.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
	<li>Humans can write and read text in a language. In AI development this is the field of <b>NLP</b> or <b>natural language processing.</b></li>
</ul>
<ul>
	<li>Humans can see with their eyes and process what they see. In AI development this is the field of <b>computer vision.</b> Computer vision falls under the <b>symbolic way</b> for computers to process information. Recently however another way to enable computer vision has been developed which we will come to later on but thought It was worth noting now.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
	<li>Also Humans recognize the scene around them through their eyes which create images of that world this field of <b>image processing</b> which even though is not directly related to AI is required for computer vision.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
	<li>Humans can understand their environment and move around fluidly about their environment. In AI development this is the field of <b>robotics.</b></li>
</ul>
<ul>
	<li>Humans have the ability to see patterns as a result we can group like objects together. In AI development this is the field of <b>pattern recognition</b></li>
</ul>
<ul>
	<li>Machines are even better at pattern recognition because they can use more data and process more dimensions of data. In AI development this is the field of <b>machine learning.</b></li>
</ul>

<h2><b>The Brain</b></h2>
<img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-133" src="https://apragmatic.files.wordpress.com/2017/07/ml-ai-brain.png" alt="ML-AI brain.png" width="316" height="102" />

The human brain is a network of neurons which we use these to learn. If we can artificially model and replicate some of the structures and the functions of the human brain, then may be able to also replicate some of the brains cognitive capabilities in machines. In AI development this is the field of <b>neural networks. </b>These artificial networks become more complex and deeper as we use them to learn and solve complex problems. In AI development this is the field of <b>deep learning.</b>

<b><img title="" src="https://apragmatic.files.wordpress.com/2018/08/image5.png" alt="" width="325" height="185" /></b>

There are different types of deep learning and machines which are essentially different techniques to replicate what the human brain does. If we get a network to scan images from left to right top to bottom it's a <b>convolution neural network </b>or <b>CNN.</b> A CNN is used to recognise objects in a scene this is how computer vision fits in and <b>object recognition</b> is accomplished.

Humans can remember the past like what you had for dinner last night. We can get a neural network to remember a limited past using a <b>recurrent neural network.</b>

&nbsp;

There are two ways in which AI works:

one is symbolic based and another is data based. The database side called a <b>machine learning</b> we need to feed the Machine lots of data before it can learn for example if you had lots of data for sales versus advertising spend you can plot that data to see some kind of a pattern. If the machine can learn this pattern then it can make predictions based on what it has learned. While humans to understand and learn 1-3 dimensions of plotted data, itâ€™s much easier for machines. Machines can learn in many more dimensions hundred or even thousands. Machines can look at lots of high dimensional data and determine patterns from thousands of data points. Once it learns these patterns it can make predictions that humans can't even come close to. We can use all these machine learning techniques to do one of two things:
<ol>
	<li><b>Classification </b></li>
</ol>
<ol>
	<li><b>Prediction</b></li>
</ol>
For example, when you use some information about customers to assign new customers to a group like young adults then you are <b>classifying</b> the customer. If you use data to predict if a customer is likely to defect to a competitor then you're making a <b>prediction.</b>

There is another way to think about learning algorithms used for AI.

If you train an algorithm with data that also contain the answer then it's called s<b>upervised learning;</b> for example, when you train a machine to recognize your friends by name you'll need to identify them for the computer.

If you train an algorithm with data where you want the machine to figure out the patterns then it's called <b>unsupervised learning;</b> for example, you might want to feed the data about celestial objects in the universe and expect the machine to come up with patterns in that data by itself.

If you give any algorithm a goal and expect the machine through trial-and-error to achieve that goal then it's called <b>reinforcement learning; </b>for example, a robot attempting to climb over the wall until it succeeds.

Hope this summary helps...
