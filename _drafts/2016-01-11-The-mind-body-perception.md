 [ _"It is totally without logic to propose that after millions of years of evolution during which mankind have become the dominant species on this planet that somehow our bodies have become structurally incompetent or that we have become so fragile that we must be careful of how we move how we use our bodies or engage in repetitive activities this is unadulterated nonsense we are not made of paper masche we are tough and resilient adaptable and quick to heal"_ ]- Dr. John Sarno


### _What is chronic pain?_
It can be mild or excruciatingly episodic or continuous merely inconvenient or totally incapacitating and has been going on for months or longer.

Anyone who has had long-term or even chronic pain knows very well that it's one of the most detrimental things to our quality of life. The pain can be caused by a variety of issues with the bones, joints, nerves, or muscles. Your doctor may have ordered X-rays or EMG tests to find the issue - and there's always something your doctor can point to. Depending on the source of the pain you'll be treated with painkillers, physical therapy or back braces in the case of back pain. Surgery is also an option but if the pain is coming from other issues (discs, ligaments, joint arthritis, myofascial pains, nerve injury) -- then surgery may not do anything for the pain. This is because like most chronic pain back pain is very difficult to treat because it is difficult to find out where the pain is coming from.

Back pain is the most common cause of job-related disability and a leading contributor to missed work days. Perhaps you yourself are suffering from chronic lower back pain or perhaps even experiencing chronic pain elsewhere such as your joints, nerves, or muscles. If so then you probably been bounced from pillar to post starting with your GP who eventually referred you to a medical specialist who advised rest. When that didn't help you were likely told to try physical therapy and then orthopaedics. That didn't work so you were you then referred to a rheumatologist or neurologist or both -- but that didn't help either so you decided to try alternative medicine; you know chiropractors, osteopaths, acupuncturists, massage therapists, nutritionists but still the pain persisted. Maybe your not suffering from chronic pain but you have you care about that is. In my opinion I believe Dr. Sarno has come further towards solving these kinds of problems that anyone in the Western medical field has ever come close to.


#### _We repress out of necessity_
Working at the Rusk Institute of Rehabilitation Medicine in New York, Dr. Sarno worked for several decades with patients who have chronic pain disorders of different kinds he is primarily a back doctor and so he has dealt mostly with back problems. He saw many cases where his patients didn’t respond as he expected to the conventional treatments of the day, considering the physical symptoms with which they presented. In addition to complaints about neck, back, and shoulder pain he noticed a connection that his patients often shared a common pattern of underlying tension.

but there are many more examples of how TMS manifests as painful symptoms and conditions. These include headaches, migraines, pelvic pain, irritable bowel and other gastrointestinal complaints, chronic fatigue, fibromyalgia, carpal tunnel and repetitive strain syndromes, TMJ, vertigo, dizziness, insomnia and even psychological equivalents such as anxiety, depression, phobias and disorders.

His approach is simple. Chronic pain is caused by repressed emotions in the unconscious mind and so his treatments involve no medication no physical therapy none of that it is purely an educational therapy. There's more, not only is repressed emotions the source chronic pain but also the source of panic attacks, depression, anxiety, leg pain; most neck shoulder and arm pain, cranial nerve pain or weakness --fibromyalgia, myofascial pain syndrome and many other similar conditions where you have pain but don't really know why it  in different ways that sometimes manifests with weaknesses in the muscles sometimes with tingling sensations but we often doctors have no idea how to actually cure them so they give drugs to help reduce the pain temporarily if we inject steroids into the base of the spine or sometimes perform surgery to see if that helps which it rarely does in the long term.

physical pain doesn’t necessarily have (only) physical causes.

no invasive medical intervention was needed.

#### _Chronic Pain: An Epidemic of Fear?_

So is there any evidence for such a claim? Well neuroscientists have shown how your occupation can alter the very structure of your brain. For instance scientists have shown that [black-cab taxi drivers have a larger (hence more developed) area of the brain responsible for storing memory called the hippocampus compared to non-taxi drivers](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC18253/) and that [gymnasts have a larger area of the brain responsible for complex movement called the cerebellum](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC18253/). Then there is the stuff of everyday life. For example when your mouth becomes dry just as you're about to address an audience; the feeling of butterflies in your stomach, the movie that makes your heart skip a beat, or those worries running around in your head that stop you from getting a wink of sleep. It's no secret that our bodies are intimately connected to our minds more so our emotions, how could it be otherwise..?

Dr. Sarno tends to see the most persistent cases people who have had problems for ten twenty or even thirty years and what he tells them is this your problems are not physical you are not injured in any way the pain however is real it's not just in your head it's real physical pain but the cause is emotional the cause is repressed rage in the unconscious mind. The purpose of the pain is to divert your attention from an internalised rage to keep it well hidden in the unconscious mind because to see it would be worse than the pain or so the unconscious mind thinks. The unconscious mind works very differently to the conscious mind and as a result of this different both respond to and process emotionally charged events and traumas very differently.

In reality we have three minds we have the conscious the unconscious and the subconscious and as Dr. Sarno explains:

_"It is an interesting fact that the overwhelming majority of emotional and mental activity occurs below the level of consciousness. The human mind is something like an iceberg. The part that we are aware of, the conscious mind, represents a very small part of the total. It is in the subconscious mind that all of the complicated processing goes on…this condition begins and ends in the unconscious."_

Sarno is primarily concerned with the first two and the third one the subconscious is a fascinating area but it's relevant here only to the extent that learning takes place in the subconscious and learning is the foundation of the therapeutic process for the other two this table might be helpful.

now you might be wondering how on earth dose this work? You might understand it intellectually what's happening and can see the reasoning behind it but how the heck does the brain accomplish such a feat? Well the truth is we don't understand nearly everything the brain actually does -- like how we think or even comprehend language. Our scientific lack of understanding also extends to the brains ability to can cause physical symptoms.

The medical community has adopted mechanical approach to treating health. That is to say that medical professionals treat the body a well oiled machine; with poor health being and or chronic pain being the malfunctioning or the breakdown of some mechanical process of the body. While this is mostly a useful analogy it completely disregards the role of the mind and emotions plays in health. This is Where a mechanical approach to medicine fall shot --it's the need for doctors to point to some sort of structural defect as the underlining cause of chronic pain.

Depression is the leading cause of disability worldwide

lack of resources, lack of trained health-care providers, and social stigma associated with mental disorders.

playing medical whack-a-mole treating symptoms and hoping the problem goes away. This is not a very effective strategy

 --this is actually public health issue that needs to be taken seriously and studied intensively.

clinical evidence suggests that it has chosen to work through the autonomic nervous system which is the subsection of the central nervous system that controls the body's involuntary functions including the circulation of blood. By mildly restricting the flow of blood to the target tissues the level of available oxygen is decreased and the result is pain if muscle or tendon are targeted or numbness and tingling or even weakness if a nerve is involved. This mild oxygen deprivation is the basis for all of these symptoms and explains why high frequency sound waves massage and exercise can cause temporary pain relief in the affected areas as it simply increases blood flow which temporarily increases oxygen levels.

activates our fight, flight or freeze response.
the oxygen in our blood supply is channeled to all the large organs needed to mount a defense against the threat.
The oxygen deprivation means we experience tension, dysfunction and physical pain.
